# covid-tracker-interoperability-infra

Infrastructure to support [covid-green-interoperability-service](https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-interoperability-service) - a service to handle interoperability between GAEN back-end services.

## Lambdas

### batch
Creates batches of exposure keys for back-end services to download. This is triggered via SQS when exposure keys are uploaded, and also run on a schedule.

### token
This lambda is used to generate tokens for access. It is not used by clients or end users.

## AWS secrets and parameters
Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager, these are populated outside of this Terraform content. Parameters are stored in AWS System Manager, these are populated by content in this repository.

## Notes

All the infrastructure set up is automated but not secrets that need to be created manually. The current list of secrets used by the app can be found in the `main.tf` file or in the Secrets Manager UI via AWS Console.

We are using **2 AZs** and **sets of 2 subnets** here to stay within the default EIP limit of 5. (3 NAT Gateways for Covid and 2 NAT Gateways for interop)

Using the same AWS account on prod as cti-prod at this time, need to increase the EIP quota increase from 5 to 10 (Case ID 7212514971)
